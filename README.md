# AI-Powered Early Disease Prediction System  

## Overview  
Ever wondered if AI could give you early insights into your health? This **AI-Powered Early Disease Prediction System** does exactly that! Using **EfficientNetB0** and machine learning, it analyzes symptoms and predicts potential diseases—helping you take early action before visiting a doctor.  

## Features  
- **AI-Powered Predictions** – Uses a deep learning model for accurate disease detection.  
- **Easy-to-Use Interface** – A simple web UI for entering symptoms.  
- **Multi-Disease Support** – Covers a variety of illnesses for early alerts.  
- **Fast & Efficient** – Quick results based on pre-trained models.  
- **Privacy-Focused** – No sensitive data storage or tracking.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, **EfficientNetB0**  
- **APIs:** Custom API for disease prediction  

## How the AI Works  
We use **EfficientNetB0**, a lightweight yet powerful deep learning model, trained on medical datasets to predict diseases based on symptoms.  
**Key Training Details:**  
-  **Dataset:** NIH Chest X-Ray
-  **Preprocessing:** Normalization, augmentation  
-  **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## 📂 Project Structure  
### 🛠 Explanation:  
- **`data/`** → Holds the dataset for training.  
- **`models/`** → Stores trained ML models.  
- **`static/`** → Contains CSS, JavaScript, and images for the frontend.  
- **`templates/`** → Holds HTML files for the user interface.  
- **`app/`** → Core application logic, including:  
  - `app.py` → Main Flask application.  
  - `model.py` → Defines and loads the ML model. 
  - `routes.py` → API endpoints and Flask routes.  
- **`requirements.txt`** → Lists dependencies.  
- **`.gitignore`** → Prevents unnecessary files from being committed.  
- ** run ** → Starting Point
